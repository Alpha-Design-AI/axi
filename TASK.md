# AXI Address Modifier Implementation Task

## Task Description
Implement an AXI address modifier that transforms AXI transaction addresses according to configurable address modification rules.

## Module Overview
This module intercepts AXI transactions and modifies their addresses based on programmable address transformation rules while preserving data integrity and AXI protocol compliance.

### Key Features
- Configurable address transformation rules
- Support for address offset, masking, and remapping
- Preserve transaction data and metadata integrity
- Maintain AXI protocol handshake correctness

## Build and Test Commands
```bash
make clean
make compile_vcs.log
cd build
../scripts/run_vcs.sh axi_modify_address
```

## Verification Requirements
Your implementation must pass the complete test suite in `tb_axi_modify_address.sv`.

**Test Information**: Address modification tests with various transformation patterns

## Analysis Hints
Carefully analyze the testbench for:
- Study address transformation rule configuration
- Understand address modification patterns and masks
- Analyze transaction flow and address calculation
- Observe data preservation requirements

## Interface Requirements
- **Input**: Standard AXI4 slave interface
- **Output**: Standard AXI4 master interface with modified addresses
- **Parameters**: Address transformation configuration
- **Signals**: Clock, reset, configuration ports
